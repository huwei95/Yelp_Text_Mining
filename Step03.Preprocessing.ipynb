       " u'yes this place is a little out dated and not opened on the weekend. but other than that the staff is always pleasant and fast to make your order. which is always spot on fresh veggies on their hoggies and other food. they also have daily specials and ice cream which is really good. i had a banana split they piled the toppings on. they win pennysaver awards ever years i see why.',\n",
       " u'this place was delicious!!  my parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from rick sebak\\'s \"25 things i like about pittsburgh\" and he\\'s usually pretty accurate.  his recommendations were to try the reuben, fish sandwich and open-faced steak sandwich.  we went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a saturday) and were seated right away.  the staff is extremely friendly.  my mom & i each had the fish sandwich, while my dad & brother had a reuben sandwich.  the fish was very good, but the reuben was to die for!  both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  on top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  the giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant reuben was $7.50.  our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  we will definitely be back!!!  oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take cash only.  so come prepared, but i\\'m pretty sure i saw an atm there as well.  and i do believe they are closed on sundays & mondays.',\n",
       " u\"can't miss stop for the best fish sandwich in pittsburgh.\",\n",
       " u'this place should have a lot more reviews - but i\\'m glad it doesn\\'t, they don\\'t need to get any busier.\\r\\n\\r\\nits been there ages, and looks it. if you\\'re all about ambiance, don\\'t bother. if you pretend you\\'re in a movie set in pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. the service is sometimes hit or miss. most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. they are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you\\'re happy. everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe food is awesome! worth any little complaints i might think up before it gets there. once its on the table, i forget them all.\\r\\n\\r\\n-fish sandwiich\\r\\n-salmon (huge and delicious)\\r\\n-flounder\\r\\n-shrimp a few ways (\"norfolk\" style is oily for my taste, and i never had it growing up in norfolk.)\\r\\n-hawkins st special\\r\\n-prime rib (sized for two, watch it)\\r\\n\\r\\nthe prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. i\\'m not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don\\'t want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem.',\n",
       " u'this place was very good. i found out about emil\\'s when watching a show called \"25 things i love about pittsburgh\" on wqed hosted by rick seback. this place ain\\'t a luxurious restaurant...it\\'s a beer & a shot bar / lounge. but the people are friendly & the food is good. i had the fish sandwich which was great. it ain\\'t in a great part of town, rankin, but i\\'ve been in worse places!! try this place.',\n",

       " u\"like a lot of recent patrons, i heard about emil's from wqed.  the food is spectacular, the owner chrissy and the staff treat you like family.  the food is like something your grandmother would make - classic dishes that are always consistently great and memorable.\",\n",
       " u\"wonderful reuben.  map shown on yelp page is incorrect. it is actually a different hawkins.  i'd recommend a call for directions 412-271-9911.\",\n",
       " u\"after a morning of thrift store hunting, a friend and i were thinking of lunch, and he suggested emil's after he'd seen chris sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and i had not. he said they had a decent reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nwell, seeing as how i'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole rat pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which i can see all around me every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nand yet another shot at finding a decent reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the holy grail. so looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\\r\\n\\r\\nso off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? at first i thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. and then...aha! here it is! and yep, there it was. this little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'emil's. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe walked in the front door, and entered another world. another time, and another place. oh, and any big burrito/sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. i wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'reaaaaaalllly?'\\r\\n\\r\\nthis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. this is the kind of neighborhood dive that i could see frank and dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. and that is exactly what i love.\\r\\n\\r\\noh...but good food counts too. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe each had a reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. the reubens were decent, but not ny awesome. a little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. not too skimpy on the meat. i seriously crave a true, good ny reuben, but since i can't afford to travel right now, what i find in da burgh will have to do. but as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. those were some big thick burgers. a steak went past for the table behind us. that was huge! and when we asked about it, the waitress said 'yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' another table of five came in, and wham. fish sandwiches piled with breaded fish that looked amazing. yeah, i want that, that, that and that!\\r\\n\\r\\nmy friend also mentioned that they have a chicken parm special one day of the week that is only served until 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. if only i could get there on that week day before 4...\\r\\n\\r\\nthe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a saturday, and only one of her. she kept up and was very friendly. \\r\\n\\r\\nthey only have pepsi products, so i had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. as the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\\r\\n\\r\\nemil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, very comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. fan-freakin-tastic! i could feel at home here.\\r\\n\\r\\nyou definitely want to hit mapquest or plug in your gps though. i am not sure that i could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. i will be making my friend take me back until i can memorize where the heck it is.\\r\\n\\r\\naddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. excellent. truly. a pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). the fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. this may have been the best fish sandwich i've yet to have in da burgh.\",\n",
       " u\"this is a hidden gem, no really. it took us forever to find but well worth it. it is right across the street from the rankin police station. the menu has a wide selection, i really couldn't decide what i wanted but i went with the ribeye sandwich. i'm glad i did too. huge sandwich! i added mushrooms, it was very flavorful. my boyfriend got the fish sandwich, he enjoyed it as well. fast and friendly service. will definitely be back.\",\n",
       " u\"from reading the other reviews, i see this place was on some top 25 places in pittsburgh list a few years ago.  i haven't seen it myself, but have known of this place for a while before my first visit in 2013.  it wasn't until my almost 80yo buddy, mr. italo donatucci (world's coolest old italian dude) brought me one of the best fish sandwiches i ever had that i became hooked!  i've had at least 10 since then, but only during the lent season.  i gave my 5 rating based on the fish sandwich alone.  try it without a bun also!  either way you get 3 nice size pieces of fish equal to a pound.  you can have your choice of sides, but i always get the small mac n cheese for my side.  the staff is always really friendly and service is prompt.  it's in a rough neighborhood, but the rankin police station is right across the street.  almost every visit there i have seen police officers inside mingling with the locals or picking up lunch orders.  soon i plan to make a visit that's not a friday during lent to try other menu items.\",\n",
       " u\"another divey place we have been going to for years. my dad's favorite, as he knows the original owners. certain items on the menu are named after the kids. huge portions, might have a bit of a wait some nights. huge burgers, fish sandwiches, salads. decent service.\",\n",
       " u\"love my hometown favorites. cannot beat their fish sandwiches (although i do miss the buns as opposed to the sliced bread...stop that). always will support emil's\\r\\nother favorites include reuben, hawkins avenue sandwich, chrissy club.\",\n",
       " u\"i love everything about this place. the food is delicious (yes yes, the fish sandwiches, ok, i agree -- but did you try the meatballs?? holy tamoley), i adore the staff, and i love that there are no windows -- it's its own little hermetically sealed 1950s world of delicious, real food and good people. lots of places try to create this kind of ambiance, but it can't be manufactured. it takes decades of good food and good vibes.\\r\\n\\r\\nalso, the food is really good. :)\",\n",
       " u\"i had a hankering for some fried fish tonight and the fish fry at maximilian kolbe was going to close before i got home on the bus, and i suggested to my wife and 12 year-old daughter that we try emil's lounge as wqed's rick seback loved the place as did andrew zimmern when he visited for the bizarre foods america episode featuring pittsburgh.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe place is in rankin - a rough around the edges town in the mon valley between swissvale and braddock.  don't be put off at first - the outside doesn't have much decoration to speak of and looks like the sort of place that you might think twice about it.  a tgi fridays it isn't... and thank god for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe place is well-kept but a little dated -  no fripperies here.  but we're not here for the decor - we're here for some dinner.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe menu is basic with reasonable prices.  the meats and seafood are high quality and everything is made to order.  their stuffed cabbage is regarded as the best in  pittsburgh.  i love stuffed cabbage but i just made a batch a couple of weeks ago and i'm cabbaged out.  their ruebens are   also killer (our waitress raved about them).  my wife and i both settled on fish sandwiches.  these are true pittsburgh fish sammiches - fresh fried fish in crispy breading, crammed between enormous pillows of soft, yet chewy and crispy mancini's italian bread.  no adornments - just a boatload of hot crispy fish.  emil's uses thick cod fillets piled high rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit in the bun.  truly a great sandwich.  my daughter had the blt - looked good and on good bread and they weren't skimpy with the bacon.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe service was very pleasant and friendly and the crowd was a great group of folks.  we all had fun with 4 other tables when my wife pulled up a trivial pursuit game on her iphone and pretty much everyone joined in and had a good laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, if you consider yourself a true pittsburgher - you must visit this place.  it's one of the few places (big jim's in the run is another) where the spirit of pittsburgh is alive and hungry.  please go.\",\n",
       " u'we have been coming here for over 30 years, consistantly good food and friendly staff. vwey reasonably priced and large portions. the owner, chrissy has taken what emil started years ago and built it into a place we will return to again and again. favorites are the fish and burgers, hard to pick one!',\n",
       " u\"we had gone to the frick mansion for a tour and i told my friends we were stopping off for a lunch in rankin. there wasn't much enthusiasm about the location but the reluctantly agreed.  we stopped in front and my wife said we aren't going in there are we? well once the order the food and enjoyed the best reuben,  fish sandwich and stuffed peppers they were sold. the owner came over and thanked us for stopping. she is a real asset to the place. the restrooms were spotless, which important to my wife. i have taken places where she had to hover  over the commode. i went back two days later for the hulushki. a real gem a perfect place to eat real comfort food. don't forget the liver and onions.\",\n",
       " u\"excellent fish sandwich, wonderful reuben sandwich, even the stuffed cabbage tastes homemade.   chrissy \\r\\nis a delightful hostess and makes you feel welcome.  restaurant personnel are pleasant.   i really enjoy visiting emils when i'm in town   my only regret is that they are closed mondays.   worth the trip\",\n",
       " u\"this would be my local haunt, if i were ever to relocate to the pittsburgh area. what a great little place! such friendly staff, and some damn good eats!\\r\\n \\r\\nit was so great, that we actually went there twice during our 4-day vacation to catch the steelers/ravens game. \\r\\n\\r\\nthey have daily sandwich specials. on thursday night we went and had the special roast beef and cheese sand., and the .35 cent wings. very, very tasty. i'm sorry, but this place kicks primanti bros. butt on the taste factor. they have about 8 different types of wings... reg., garlic, and i can't remember the rest - we got the regular, and i was wishing we would had ordered more.\\r\\n\\r\\ngoing back on a friday night, we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and a pepperoni n' mushroom.  wow! that buffalo chicken pizza was awesome.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe other thing that stuck out for me was one of the customers. an older gentleman; he seemed to be a regular. i really, really wanted his spam t-shirt.\",\n",
       " u\"a great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele. i went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one friday night and it didn't disappoint. it is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - i'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. the other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and i wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. an overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (i know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, canned mushrooms - the worst thing to come out of a can. ever. i would rather eat canned alpo than canned mushrooms. and if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms i've ever consumed. the mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!\\r\\n\\r\\nmy advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, i'll never know.\",\n",
       " u\"alexion's has been around forever.  the first time i went in there, i was 19 years old on summer break from college and working at the ice cream factory up the hill.  all of the union guys from the ice cream factory went in there after work, and i immediately found out why.  many, many years later, i stopped in there with some fond memories, and once again felt welcomed and valued as a customer, even though they didn't know who i was.  the sandwiches are done pittsburgh-style, sort of like primanti's, and they are as perfect today as they were back in ancient times when i first started visiting the place.  alexion's is a clean and peaceful little place in the rook station part of green tree, the oldest part of the town.  i recall that some of the sandwiches i got there were ordered at a pretty late hour.  nothing but good things to say about the place, and i wish it was closer to home!\",\n",
       " u'good for cheap drinks and wings, they offer daily specials which is nice. \\r\\n\\r\\ndoesnt look like much from outside but the inside is friendly enough, the bartenders have been there for awhile and do a good job. dont expect to have a huge selection of alcohol. \\r\\n\\r\\ntheir wings are good as are their salads. if you are gluten free this is not your place...lots of fried food and sandwiches. \\r\\noffers a quick lunch.',\n",
       " u'what a cool bar/restaurant.. i will no doubt be visiting again.  the service and prices were great.. and the restrooms were clean.   i had the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was delicious.  the menu consists of typical bar food food, however; theres a few different items on there which stand out on the menu..\\r\\n\\r\\na cool bar off the beaten path that is a worth a trip.  \\r\\n\\r\\ncheers ! !',\n",
       " u'awesome drink specials during happy hour. fantastic wings that are crispy and delicious, wing night on tuesday and thursday!',\n",
       " u\"good beer selection. understaffed for a light monday night crowd, it wasn't her fault she was the only server. but it took about an hour to get our sandwiches. mine was one of the best reubens i've ever had.\",\n",
       " u\"grew up near here. the family would always go once a month. haven't stopped in for a few years until last friday with a few friends to grab a drink. the sandwiches are always amazing just as i remember. the staff is amazing and friendly. great place for lunch as well.\",\n",
       " u\"very disappointed in the customer service. we ordered reuben's  and wanted coleslaw instead of kraut. they charged us $3.00 for the coleslaw. we will not be back . the iced tea is also terrible tasting.\",\n",
       " u\"let there be no question: alexions owns the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades. try a burger on italian bread. the service is flawlessly friendly, the food is amazing, and the wings? oh the wings... but it's still about the cheeseburger. the atmosphere is inviting, but you can't eat atmosphere... so go right now. grab the car keys... you know you're hungry for an amazing cheeseburger, maybe some wings, and a cold beer! easily, hands down, the best bar and grill in pittsburgh.\",\n",
       " u\"the sandwiches, the wings, enough said. alexions can best be described as a home-style primantis before they went mega commercial. you really can't go wrong, but for my money, i would put alexions fish sandwich up with the best i've had. that's not to take away from other selections, but if you come here i recommend not leaving until you've had either the fish sandwich, reuben, or wings. \\r\\n\\r\\nyou'll know you're in a pittsburgh bar when you walk in. for someone who lives in atlanta now and only makes it to pittsburgh a few times a year, i have to say it is refreshing. feels like home. i haven't had a trip back without making it out to alexions at least once.\",\n",
       " u\"we met a couple of friends there on a friday afternoon about 440 pm, based on the yelp reviews. i've relied on yelp in over a dozen different cities, never came away with anything less than a positive experience until today. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe ordered within 5 minutes of sitting down, there couldn't have been more than 20 people in the place, counting the people on the patio.  took them almost 40 minutes to serve 3 sandwiches and a salad. i tried the fish sandwich, came out fried extra crispy on the ends, if there is such a thing as fish jerky a third of the sandwich would have qualified, it was just ok. i've had better at almost any church that fries fish during lent. \\r\\n\\r\\nall 3 of my dinner companions left partial sandwiches  or salad uneaten. bread french fries and onion rings were good though. iced tea was good, though i've never seen a place dispense sweet n low like they were giving away their last rock of crack. asked for sugar but never saw any, they don't carry any other artificial sweeteners besides the pink stuff.\\r\\n\\r\\ni may give the place another try in the future for a reuben or hamburger, assuming today was some aberration possibly due to a cook having a family emergency or something like that. waitress was pretty good, held up under my multiple requests to find out if they caught my fish yet, hardly ever rolled her eyes :)\",\n",
       " u\"the bar is nice enough the servers are attentive enough the food is good enough. their is absolutely nothing wrong with this place but the problem is it is not a place that will stick out from the crowd. it's kind of lost in the crowd. pittsburgh is a city full of bars this one is relaxed. it's a great neighborhood bar. and i would come back but it is not a wow that is a great place.  it's just good enough\",\n",

       " u\"i have never seen a restaurant that has a frowning brownie (a.k.a. frownie) as their icon, mascot, or spokesperson.  king's family restaurant has surprised me with this.  i think it might be in direct dialogue with eat n' parks smiling cookie -- funny (funny odd, not funny ha-ha).  we were seated rather quickly by the manager.  very nice people work here, i was happy to find that even though they had closed a section, the server was willing to stay longer to serve us our dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe chatted with the server a little bit -- she was quite engaging -- and then moved on to order our meal:\\r\\n\\r\\ntea\\r\\npepsi\\r\\nopen-faced hot turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy\\r\\nbuffalo chicken strips with mashed potatoes and macaroni n' cheese\\r\\n\\r\\nour drinks arrived and our server conversed with us some more about the area.  she would leave every couple of minutes to check on our food and to make certain that her other tables had everything they needed.  eventually, our entrees arrived -- both piping hot.  i went straight for the macaroni and cheese.  it didn't taste bad, but i swear that it is made by stouffers.  i didn't feel the need to eat that much knowing that there were other things to eat.  i tried the mashed potatoes and found that they too came from a package; but, again, they didn't taste bad with the brown gravy.  i moved on to the main part of my meal -- the buffalo chicken strips.  at least they were all white meat and the buffalo sauce was more than just mild.  i contented myself with eating them.  \\r\\n\\r\\ni tried some of the hot turkey sandwich and just left the rest for my friend since it was not fresh cut turkey but instead luncheon meat that had been heated.  i finished off my dinner and was happy in the end.  no, it wasn't the best food in the world, but the service greatly helped the perception and it didn't taste bad.\",\n",
       " u\"so... back in the late 90s, there used to be this super-kick-ass cinnamon ice cream, like an apple pie ice cream without the apples or the pie crust.  so delicious!\\r\\n\\r\\nhowever, now there is some shit-tastic replacement that tastes like vanilla ice cream with last year's red-hot in the middle: totally gross.  fortunately, our server was nice enough to warn me about the change and bring me a sample, so i only had to suffer the death of a childhood memory rather than also having to pay for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe portions are big and filling, just don't come for the ice cream.\",\n",
       " u\"ive pretty much been eating at various kings' pretty regularly since i was a child when my parents would take my sister and i into the fox chapel location often.  lately me and my girl have been visiting the heidelburg location. i love the food, it really tastes homemade, much like something a grandmother would make, complete with gobs of butter and side dishes. prices are low, selection is great, but dont expect fine dining by any means. \\r\\n\\r\\nservice is hit or miss at pretty much all of them; if you have lunch at any kings, you will likely be waited on by a sweet but sarcastic  older lady who has been doing the waiting thing for 30 years and knows her game. seek out this lady.  my experience with the younger crowd at night isnt the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nim in my 30s now, and very little has changed, other than the fox chapel location was remodeled about 10 years ago to look less like a diner, which was a big fail.  any girl i meet has to enjoy kings or she's out.\",\n",

       " u\"two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, i was compelled to write. 'rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\non the first trip, i went to try their (at that time)raved about reuben. and yet to find a true good reuben in da burgh, i tried it.\\r\\n\\r\\nwell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' reubens, i received two mini-reubens, which basically took the guts from one reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. i ate it. it wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. bread or not, it still wasn't great. the atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the reuben.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen tv covering the sports of the moment.\\r\\n\\r\\ni was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. my friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. it was a basic salad, no big deal. more or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when i placed my order. i asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. i never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. it literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. the first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of kentucky fried chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. \\r\\n\\r\\nafter the second trip back i heard the cook holler 'tell him i'll fix him up'. \\r\\n\\r\\nwell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank goodness for the basic salad bar.\\r\\n\\r\\neven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. they also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. ahhhh da burgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nthird base? nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.\\r\\n\\r\\nfrom what i understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. but apparently, mama has left the kitchen.\",\n",

       " u'this is a great little gem!  on my last visit to pittsburgh i was looking for a nice bar/pub/lounge to grab dinner and watch a penguins playoff game.  a friend of mine who lived in the area recommended rocky\\'s.  as i walked in the door i was pleasantly approached by the server and shown a table. it was clean, welcoming and the lounge was busy. it was friday night and the special was the fish fry.  i ordered the fish and in the meantime i sipped on a draft brew.  the order was delivered to my table in no time.  the fish and sides were tasty and the portion size was large. as i was watching the game and enjoying the heck out of my dinner i noticed a dessert case with a nice selection of cakes.  well needless to say i got a togo box for what was left of my dinner and ordered a slice of cheesecake.  another good choice!  at the end of night the penguins couldn\\'t pull off the win over the rangers but i definitely have a new \"go to\" when i\\'m in town.  another star could be added for a smoke free environment.  i don\\'t smoke but i understand they have a nice outdoor area for those who do.',\n",

       " u\"i have been to this place a million times over the years. have been there during the years it was less than clean, to the present where it is almost clean. this place is a neighborhood standard that for some reason compels you to return, even if your experience was less than stellar. fancy it is not. gourmet it is definitely not. every item on the menu seems to come from a can, bag ,bucket or box. the wait staff is often clueless and changes like the wind. i have never had the same server twice. but the fact is you get a decent meal for a decent price and always have a little to take home. yes, the salad bar is very basic. not every item is a fresh as it should be. the iced tea often takes on the taste of lord knows what. however,  the fried fish dinner is one of the best i have had anywhere in picksburg. their meatloaf is terrific as are several of their hoagies. in a nutshell, this place has a lot of flaws. like we all do. a few upgrades like a better wait staff, fresh gravy instead of their gallon bucket brand, homemade sauce instead of whatever canned stuff they are using would jump this review to 5 stars. rocky's is worth going to. you will definitely find something you like and you will definitely go back. decent food, decent price, good portions and an overall pleasant experience.\",\n",

       " u'readers of my reviews may recall that i once referred to the dor-stop as possibly the best breakfast in pittsburgh.  well, faithful followers, i must now admit that the dor-stop has now been verified as only one of the best.  why?  that\\'s because gab and eat i have now found to be the best breakfast i\\'ve ever had.  if it was closer to my home i would quickly become a regular.\\r\\n\\r\\ni easily decided to order the mixed grill (half).  before i go on, i must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  because i honestly can\\'t imagine how much food that is.  i created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  based on reviews i also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if i wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.  i like variety, so i jumped on the change to try both.  i also selected the italian toast - what other kind is there, really?  \\r\\n\\r\\nwhen my food arrived, it looked delicious.  there was so much bacon that after eating half of my mixed grill it looked like i\\'d barely started.  the sausage was great, just don\\'t ask me which one i liked best.  my toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. it was a struggle, but i was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   \\r\\n\\r\\nin case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  i saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  the wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.  the fact that none of the plates match and i noticed a sign at the front register that said, \"we need mugs\" just makes me love this place even more.\\r\\n\\r\\na few tips: 1.) order the mixed grill.  2.) cash only!  3.) gab and eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow (or cozy if you will).  i recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group.  that way you won\\'t feel rushed or crowded.  4.) get to gab and eat asap!  you\\'ll be glad you did!',\n",
       " u\"classic breakfast joint.  grimy looking hole in the wall located on one end of a seedy looking strip mall.  window is opaque due to the grease so you can't hardly see inside. on the outside, there are about a dozen people waiting to get in.  when you finally do get inside, you see that there are 15 tables and a counter, all occupied by people from all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat's the attraction behind this flea hole?  the food!  lots of it and dirt cheap.  i sat at a vacant stool behind the formica counter and ordered the mixed grill.  potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon and italian toast.  a giant mound of food guaranteed to sooth any hangover.  i swear the full mixed grill had two pounds of food.  neat thing is that the grill is right in front of you so you can see your potatoes and eggs frying in a pool of fresh grease.  all that food, plus coffee and tip for around ten bucks.  cash only, so put that plastic away.\\r\\n\\r\\nonly bad thing that could happen is some douche bag from the food network or travel channel will make this place famous, and then i'll never be able to get in.\",\n",

       " u\"on our current road trip of baseball, brews, hockey and diners, we decided to try gab & eat based on yelpers rating putting it #1 for breakfast in pittsburgh area. we have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat.\\r\\nwe arrived around noon on saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. the place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. there is plenty of parking.\\r\\ninside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. we regretted not having a marker to add ours. the other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food.\\r\\nthe waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. they are attentive, pleasant and efficient.\\r\\nafter reading reviews i had to try the mixed grill. but s went with pancakes with a side of bacon. the pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. they were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. \\r\\nhis bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful.\\r\\nthe mixed grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy italian sausage grilled together. i'm glad i heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. it filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. i couldn't finish it all and that's rare. how do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?\\r\\neverything was cooked well. the sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. you can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.\\r\\nmy only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. i like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. these potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. personal preference.\\r\\nit usually comes with italian toast but they were out so i went with raisin. it was delicious soft inch thick slices.\\r\\ncoffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. the total was less than $15. fabulous value for the quality and portions.\\r\\nwhile i can't say it's the best breakfast in pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had.\",\n",
       " u\"met my nephew for lunch in carnegie and he suggested gab & eat.   way to go justin!  the restaurant is in a strip mall across from the dairy queen.  the grill is right up front so you can see them cooking.   they have counter space for eating and tables/booths for 4.   don't expect to sit at one table if you have more than 4. they have a great looking breakfast menu.   we all got burgers of varying kinds!  they were tasty!   the buns were buttered, toasted and soft.  yum!   the amount of butter didnt bother me  but it did my whiny mother. who whined even though there is a no whining sign as you walk in the door.   we ordered fresh cut fries as onion rings.  both of which were great.  the half order was plenty and a nice option to a full order.   the restaurant was full of local men at lunch which is usually a good sign.  i give it a 4 star only because of the waitress who kind of threw straws, silverware and napkins at us as she walked behind the counter.  at least she didn't throw the food when it came!   she also served the fries and onion rings way before our burgers came out which was kind of weird.   they were nice and hot but would have been cold had we waited for the burgers.   it didn't factor into my four star rating but i deduct a star from nephew because he invited us out to lunch then allowed me pay!   just kidding justin!   love ya!\",\n",

       " u\"i have been coming to gab n eat for almost 20 years and they have never let me down. i get a typical breakfast if eggs, ham, toast, and home fries. delicious as usual. the ambience however is usually lacking. the walls are dark, with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place. pictures of local people hang on the walls(i secretly want mine up there) along with posters galore. while its fun to look at the first 10 times, it gets a little boring after awhile. so today when i arrived i expected the same old experience. wow was i wrong! as soon as i looked at the door i knew something was different. the place seemed lighter and brighter. to my pleasant surprise, they painted and got new counter tops!! they're not quite done yet but the place has a new happy vibe to it. the awesome breakfast, the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why i will be back( maybe for lunch).\",\n",

(when at gab n eat. you have to order the 1/2 grill) i had mine with bacon. bacon was crisp and delish. and m ordered the regular mixed grill. we also shared an order of potato pancakes. they even brought us 2 sides of applesauce and sour cream. the pancakes could have been a tiny bit crisper, but still very good.',\n",
       " u\"really just ok. it was chaotic and no one alerted us to whether we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated, and when we tried to ask a woman working behind the counter, she gave us a dirty look like we weren't welcome there. eventually we just sat down and someone came by to take our order. the server was nice enough, but wasn't very quick with the coffee refills - i finished my first cup slowly and then it sat empty for about five minutes. food was ok, but not amazing. we got the mixed grill and a pancake, and both were solid but not outstanding. \\r\\nnot a bad place to go, but we probably won't go out of our way to go here again, either.\",\n",

       " u\"this place is divey but cute. the food is obviously not five-star, but it's a great place if you want to get a good, hearty breakfast. we went there for lunch and got burgers...oddly enough the server said that they don't sell french fries on sundays.....? so we had to settle for home fries. i thought it was a little weird at first, but damn, those home fries were good! i didn't even care after that. the coffee is great too!\\r\\nit's a unique little place. it's basically one long strip of a kitchen, then booths set up right beside it! they also have a pretty cool breakfast bar where you can sit and watch them grill all of the food to order. the coffee cups didn't match - they were all christmas mugs lol - they have a wall in the back where you can sign your name with a dry erase marker, and they have little trivia boards on the wall just for fun. it's definitely a place of it's own kind. the prices are very reasonable, and i would definitely go back again.\",\n",

       " u\"great diner. some of the best breakfast sausage i've ever had. my wife didn't like how her omelet was prepared (it appeared they just took scrambled eggs and folded the omelet ingredients in the middle) but everything else was great including my son's pancake.\",\n",
       " u\"one of my favorite breakfast stops in pittsburgh! can't beat the hometown feel of this place. always had great service.\",\n",
       " u\"we came here once before and remember it not being very good, but figured we'd give it another shot since it's pretty close to our home. it's still just ok. we didn't have to wait this time (saturday morning at 10:30), but there was a wait throughout the time we were there. the menu is very basic- no specialty pancakes, waffles, or french toast and only 1 specialty omelette. there were no meal options, so if you want home fries or something, it's extra. the omelettes do include toast. (great bread, btw!) we had to wait a while for our food, which was surprising because we've been to a lot of diners. my husband and i both got omelettes and agreed that the contents were not really cooked with the egg. it's almost like the egg was completely cooked and someone threw the cooked contents in there and just folded it over. as for my mushroom and cheese omelette, the cheese was lacking. my biggest peev about this place is that it's cash only. perhaps i missed it, but i'm pretty sure this wasn't noted anywhere on the menu or the front door. thankfully, we had enough to cover our bill, but's not a good way to end the meal when you're scrambling and digging for change. there are a lot of good diners in the area, so i doubt we'll be going back.\",\n",
       " u\"one of those places you only hear about from a friend...tucked in a strip mall...only open for breakfast and lunch. the local atmosphere surpasses the food and that's a helluva compliment.  \\r\\n\\r\\nmixed grill is the choice for breakfast.  they will mix and match meats and how you want your eggs along with toast. \\r\\n\\r\\ntheir burgers are up there with the best in pittsburgh. \\r\\n\\r\\na hidden gem. don't miss it.\"]"
