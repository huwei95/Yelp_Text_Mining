      "(Up front apology..... this is a slight reworked review from others I've done on Brazilian BBQ's in the Western states.) And know that I'd like to have given Texas a 3.75 stars if it existed, but have given the new Fogo in LV 4 stars, mainly for the meat quality. \r",

      "Our family is Brasilian. Here in Orange County, CA, we and our group of friends have tried just about every churrascaria that's opened or is still open in the Southwest. Many of us, during business travels, have also had the opportunity to sample US based Brasilian BBQ both on the East and West Coasts, and some in-between places..........like Salt Lake City, UT. Restaurant reviews need a reference point, and Brasilian BBQ's most especially.\r",
      "\r\n",
      "\r",
      "\r\n",
      "Over the last 20 years, we've watched them come and go; some very good, some horrible. Yolie's of Las Vegas, for example and IMHO, is on the \"horrible\" end. Problem with the Brasilian BBQ restaurants is their ability to be \"consistent.\" While good food is a necessity, the style of service, called \"Rodizio\", is critical. And well trained \"Gauchos\", or meat-servers, are usually the breakpoint as to whether a churracaria is going to be rated high. \r",
      "\r\n",
      "\r",
      "\r\n",
      "Consider that most reviewers have had limited exposure to traditional churrascarias. In Brasil a churracaria can be a contained in a bus stop - gas station area, or as a full-on up-scale stand-alone restaurant. Regardless of size or ambience, it's primarily about the quality of the buffet, meats and the service. Example; \"The service here was excellent!\" That's probably true and understandable if you've never had a server bring filet to your table, multiple times. But \"excellent service\" at a Brasilian churrascaria includes a gaucho-server that knows his meats, asks you for your perferences, knows how to pass your table and show what's available without disturbing your eating. And again, they should be more than willing to help you with special requests.\r",
      "\r\n",
      "\r",
      "\r\n",
      "What you should expect from an excellent churrascaria is a hot and cold buffet style entree and salad bar. In Brazil, and at high end establishments, this includes high quality sushi and sashimi, and of course, rice, black beans and various vinigrettes and dressings. If you are a vegetarian, a great churrascaria should be able to keep you as full as your carnivor friends, with equal or better quality items. Service and food are usually what Brasilians speak of when chatting about their restaurant experience. It's a three-point system. And properly rated, you would seperate them, rate them, and then total up the score.\r",
      "\r\n",
      "\r",
      "\r\n",
      "Traveling through the US, my opinion is that there are no \"great Brasilian BBQ's.\" Fogo de Chao in Dallas-Ft. Worth, so far, is the best experience I've had, while their Beverly Hills location was very dissappointing. T de B is adequate, but definitely not \"great.\"  \r",
      "\r\n",
      "\r",
      "\r\n",
      "If meat is your pleasure, then make sure to let the Gaucho-server and staff know your preferences.

It is certainly much closer to traditional churracaria than any of the LV Strip hotel restaurants. I've tried them all and was sorely disappointed. If you're in the SoCal area, and close to John Wayne Airport, try Agora at Main and McArthur. If in the Long Beach area, a good \"blue collar\" consistently OK spot is Greenfield's. \r",
